# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by day. Each day has its own directory (e.g., `01/`, `02/`, etc.) which typically contains:
*   `input.txt`: The personal puzzle input for that day.
*   `test.txt`: Example test cases provided in the puzzle description.

Solutions are implemented in two languages:

*   **Rust**: Located in the `rust/` directory.
*   **Haskell**: Located in the `haskell/` directory.

## Running Solutions

### Rust

To run a Rust solution for a specific day (e.g., Day 01):

1.  Navigate to the `rust/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd rust
    ```
2.  Run the solution using Cargo:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin day01
    ```
    (Replace `day01` with `day02`, `day03`, etc., for other days.)

### Haskell

To run a Haskell solution for a specific day (e.g., Day 01):

1.  Navigate to the `haskell/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd haskell
    ```
2.  Build and run the solution using Cabal:
    ```bash
    cabal run day01
    ```
    (Replace `day01` with `day02`, `day03`, etc., for other days.)
